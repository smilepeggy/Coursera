## Assignment 4-solution
Task: 

* The idea of this assignment is to take an existing array of names and then output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J" or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". So, the final output
on the console should look like this:

Hello Yaakov

Good Bye John

Good Bye Jen

Good Bye Jason

Hello Paul

Hello Frank

Hello Larry

Hello Paula

Hello Laura

Good Bye Jim
